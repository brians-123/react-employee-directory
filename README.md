## Description <a id="description"></a> :page_facing_up:

This app utilizes the randomuser api to grab a random set of 50 people that we will refer to as employees. The app is broken down into 4 components and utilizes hooks to pass information between these components. Filtering reduces the number of results based on the first name column and sorting will allow for any column to be sorted in ascending or descending order.
